                <td colspan="2">The aim of this thesis was to create an application simulating changes in the dynamics of local temperature on the surface of a ferromagnetic metal subjected to a high-intensity pulse laser beam working in the picosecond and femtosecond regimes. Changes in the dynamics of temperatures in the area of the incident beam are presented on a graph using the Qt graphic package. The simulations were carried out using the C ++ language and the three temperature model, which in the case of femtosecond lasers assumes different temperatures for the electron system, the vibrating crystal lattice and the electron-polarized spin system. The main emphasis was placed on the numerical methods used, which were described along with their derivation. The functional specification of the application and solutions related to the technical issues of the program were presented. In addition, a short user manual has also been prepared.
